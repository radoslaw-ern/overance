# Overance

## Description

This is a web application that allows you to manage your data in a form. You can add and delete fields with some predefined limitations:

- 3 fields initially
- 10 fields maximum
- 1 field minimum

It also provides a search functionality to find your data.\
Next to each field there is a vowel count (a, e, i, o, y, u). It works both for lower and upper case.

This project was developed using the [Vue 3](https://vuejs.org/) framework and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), under [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version [21.5.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.5.0), and it was bundled with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). The User Interface was build with the [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/) framework. It uses [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/) for state management. The code was autoformatted with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
